  Instead of including 'sentry.liquid' directly, 'sentry-top-of-page' should be
  included at the top of the file, and 'sentry-end-of-page' should be included
  at the end of the file (see comments in 'sentry-top-of-page.liquid').

  To ensure backwards compatibility, this file will make sure that 'sentry' can
  still be included (although, in Dev, it will show a bunch of errors).

    If we're running in dev, show a warning when sentry.liquid is used.
